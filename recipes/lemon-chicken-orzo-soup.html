        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook orzo in the boiling water until partially cooked through 
                but not yet soft, about 5 minutes; 
                drain and rinse with cold water until cooled completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
                Cook and stir carrots, celery, and onion in hot oil until 
                the vegetables begin to soften and the onion becomes translucent, 
                5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 
                about 1 minute more. Season mixture with thyme, oregano, salt, 
                black pepper, and bay leaf; continue cooking another 30 seconds 
                before pouring chicken broth into the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the broth to a boil. Partially cover the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, 
                and simmer until the vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir orzo, lemon juice, and lemon zest into the broth; 
                add chicken. Cook until the chicken and orzo are heated through, 
                about 5 minutes. Add baby spinach; cook until the spinach wilts into 
                the broth and the orzo is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle soup into 
                bowls; garnish with lemon slices and Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
